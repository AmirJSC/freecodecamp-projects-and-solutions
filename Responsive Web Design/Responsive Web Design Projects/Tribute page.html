				<p style="font-size: 1.5em; margin: 3%"><strong>Here's a time line of Albert Einstein's life:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>1879</strong> - 
					Born to Hermann Einstein (a featherbed salesman) and his wife Pauline in Ulm, Germany.</li>
					<li><strong>1884</strong> - 
					Receives his first compass around this time, inspiring a lifelong quest to investigate mysteries of the natural world.</li>
					<li><strong>1889</strong> - 
					Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can.</li>
					<li><strong>1895</strong> - 
					Attempts to skip high school by taking an entrance exam to the Swiss Polytechnic, a top technical university, but fails the arts portion. His family sends him to the Swiss town of Aarau to finish high school.</li>
					<li><strong>1900</strong> - 
					Graduates from the ETH.</li>
					<li><strong>1902</strong> - 
					In January, Maric gives birth to their daughter, Lieserl, whom they eventually put up for adoption. Lieserl reportedly becomes ill, and then all record of her disappears. Einstein takes a job at the Swiss Patent Office. Hermann Einstein becomes ill and dies.</li>
					<li><strong>1905</strong> - 
					Publishes, at age 26, five groundbreaking papers, making this his "annus mirabilis," or miracle year. One of the papers introduces his special theory of relativity and another E = mc2.</li>
					<li><strong>1907</strong> - 
					Begins applying the laws of gravity to his special theory of relativity.</li>
					<li><strong>1911</strong> - 
					Moves with his family to Prague, where he is given a full professorship at the German University there. Attends the invitation-only Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first world physics conference; he is the youngest physicist there.</li>
					<li><strong>1912</strong> - 
					Moves with his family to Zurich, where he becomes a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH.</li>
					<li><strong>1915</strong> - 
					Completes the general theory of relativity.</li>
					<li><strong>1919</strong> - 
					Marries Löwenthal. On May 29, a solar eclipse provides proof of the general theory of relativity.</li>
					<li><strong>1922</strong> - 
					Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1921.</li>
					<li><strong>1928</strong> - 
					Begins pursuing his idea of a unified field theory.</li>
					<li><strong>1933</strong> - 
					Sets sail with Löwenthal for the United States. Settles with her in Princeton, New Jersey, where he assumes a post at the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>
					<li><strong>1939</strong> - 
					Writes a famous letter to President Franklin Roosevelt not long after the start of World War II that warns of the possibility of Germany's building an atomic bomb and urges nuclear research.</li>
					<li><strong>1955</strong> - 
					Dies of heart failure on April 18.</li>

				<p>“A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”
				― Albert Einstein</p>
